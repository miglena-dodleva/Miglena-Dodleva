# Hey, I'm Miglena 👋

In the home stretch of my Software Engineering degree, I've loved every second of turning complex problems into elegant solutions. I'm all about diving deep into code and coming up with something cool and user-friendly.

What really gets me going is the constant change in the tech world—it's a wild ride, and I'm here for it! I thrive in teams where we can toss ideas around and everyone's voice matters.

As I gear up to bring my skills to the professional stage, I'm looking for a place where I can keep growing and have a real impact with my work. Got an interesting challenge or want to geek out about tech? Drop me a line!
